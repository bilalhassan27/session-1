# first program
# calculate area of a circle
# A=Ï€ r 2

# Area of circle =pie *radius**2

pie= 3.14115
diam=14
radi=diam/2

input pie value
input radius value
calculate area by:
pie times r square
display area of circle

# input miles
# input name
# convert kms to miles by:
# miles is 1.6*kms
# display kms with name
